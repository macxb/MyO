# Things do Change in Myriad Ways

> "When we were alone, we fought ourselves.</br> When we encountered others, we fought them and they fought us.</br> Then we ALL realised, we were just waisting time...</br> We are from Myriad Origins, BUT WE ARE ONE CLAN."</br>

This games’ main aim is to give a total gaming experience by providing all types of GamePlay with different Game Type Modules (GTMs) in one game within a commonly themed universe, Scoreboard for each GTM and an overall Game scoreboard (Top).
This will allow Gamers to become proficient in the GTMs of their choice or in all of them. Gamers now look to escape “enslaving” Gameplay and we want to help them do that!

## Backstory
* When Mars was finally colonised in 2030 we hoped for a new start. A new world, a new way.
* Under the 2025 United Mars Treaty no colonisation of any part of Mars could take place in the name of a single Terran country.
* In 2045 the Mars Interim Committee was disbanded & the Mars Government Union was instituted.
* In 2050 the MGU was granted full authority & independence over Martian Planetary & aerospace affairs.
* In 2061 MGU formally petitioned full authority over Martian Spatial Territory which was denied by Terran authorities causing the blockade of metal exports from Mars by Martian authorities creating a financial crash on earth.  This led to an interplanetary dispute which resulted in the Mars Unilateral Agreement, a declaration of total independence from the earth.
* We prepared for war; we had practice, killing our own...
* Then the [Race 2] arrived & sat, without communication or movement, on the outskirts of the Sol system & we continued preparing for war. Against a different enemy.
* Both Earth & Mars united against this perceived common enemy.
* Before contact was even made, war was prepared.  The alien race sent repeated scout ships, never communicating, never interacting. 
* The first Human space fleet was assembled & began its journey towards the alien armada, vastly outnumbered & towards almost certain defeat.
* When an alien scout passing close to a mining asteroid explosion rescued all surviving humans and left them in the nearest human outpost. The Human race paused, the fleet was ordered to halt and remain in place.
* The interplanetary social networks were aflame! The public demand for attempts at communication with the now popularly called “visitors” grew.  The crew of the alien scout were proclaimed heroes by the public, even without knowing anything about them.
* Then the same scout returned from its fleet & stopped in Terran geosynchronous orbit, above the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. 
* A single message was received: “Permission to land.”

### Overview 
* In the recent past the earth has finally made contact with aliens.
* Then with a galaxy destroying disaster in another galaxy, caused by a war between two of the galaxies’ races. A system of Clans was formally instituted and Clan sizes were limited.
* War above Clan level was forbidden in all known galaxies.
* Race & origin lost importance and Clan became paramount.

## Ideas

#### Galaxy Composition
- Round galaxy composed of triangular sectors that in their turn are composed of quadrants.

#### Geometric term: Quadrant
"Fourth part of the circumference or circle between two perpendicular radials.
Astronomical instrument of the type of the quintant and the sextant, and of analogous application in boats and airplanes, whose sector comprises only 45 degrees or the eighth part (octant) of the circle." 
- THE IMAGES ARE ONLY TO GIVE A GENERAL IDEA

#### Planets
- The planets closer to the center of the galaxy will have greater mass and therefore more gravitational pull. The reason for this will be the instability of the space-time continuum on the outskirts of the galaxy.

#### Nexus Clone Lab
- Cross race bonus genetics available under certain conditions.

#### PVP & PLANET DROP
- conquer asteroids that allow planets to descend and take advantage of it
- Once you have conquered the asteroid you can start the assembly of a BIOTAR
- the game on the planets will be in the first person (shooter)
- players without clan can put bases
- more than one asteroid per planet
- pvp maps there will be no bases
- pvp maps give + 10% more damage
- for winning micro-events you will gain 5% + damage on pvp maps the next day (24 hours)
- players above x level could not start attacks on players below x level in beginner sectors
- Level Protection will not work in pvp and advanced sectors

#### The Planetary Effect  
- Depending on the mass of the planet that the gravity of the same varies:
  - Modifying in this way the gameplay
  - The greater the gravity the slower the movement speed 
  - Shorter jumps and vice versa
  - Also affecting other conditions in accordance with the Game Universe Standard (GUS).
  
 #### Myriad Alliances   
- Joint bases can be built by clans that are allied.
- The percentages of rewards of what the base destroys will be shared between the two clans depending on the percentage of the base that the clan has built.
- Two allied clans can not build base together until they have been allied for a certain time.
- Between the clans there will be no "No Aggression Pacts", that is to say, if there are diplomatic relations they will only be alliances or enemies.

#### All's Fairplay in Love and War
- If a player in a clan declares war on another clan they will not be able to leave the clan until the war finishes
- Wars will last no longer than 14 days
- No more than 2 consecutive wars can be declared on the same clan in a 42 day period.

#### Just Because...
- Randomly appearing black holes that kill everything. Just because...
