This games’ main aim is to give a total gaming experience by providing all types of Gameplay with different Game Type Modules (GTMs) in one game with a commonly themed universe, Scoreboard for each GTM and an overall Game scoreboard (Top).
This will allow Gamers to become proficient in the GTMs of their choice or in all of them. Gamers now look to escape “enslaving” Gameplay and that’s what we want to do!
